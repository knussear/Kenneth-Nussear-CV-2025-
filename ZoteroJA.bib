	abstract = {Abstract
          High population density should drive individuals to more frequently share space and interact, producing better-connected spatial and social networks. Despite this widely-held assumption, it remains unconfirmed how local density generally drives individuals’ positions within wild animal networks. We analysed 34 datasets of simultaneous spatial and social behaviour in {\textgreater}55,000 individual animals, spanning 28 species of fish, reptiles, birds, mammals, and insects. {\textgreater}80\% of systems exhibited strongly positive relationships between local density and network centrality, providing broad empirical evidence that local density increases connectedness at the individual level. However, {\textgreater}75\% of density-connectedness relationships were nonlinear, and density’s importance declined at higher values in {\textgreater}70\% of systems, signifying saturating effects. Density’s effect was much stronger and less saturating for spatial than social networks, suggesting population density drives individuals to become disproportionately spatially connected rather than socially. These findings reveal fundamental trends underlying societal structuring, with widespread behavioural, ecological, and evolutionary implications.},

	abstract = {Forecasting range shifts in response to climate change requires accurate species distribution models (SDMs), particularly at the
margins of species' ranges. However, most studies producing SDMs rely on sparse species occurrence datasets from herbarium
records and public databases, along with random pseudoabsences. While environmental covariates used to fit SDMS are increasingly
precise due to satellite data, the availability of species occurrence records is still a large source of bias in model predictions. We
developed distribution models for hybridizing sister species of western and eastern Joshua trees (Yucca brevifolia and Y.
jaegeriana; respectively), iconic Mojave Desert species that are threatened by climate change. We conducted an intensive visual
grid search of online satellite imagery for 672,043 0.25 km 2 grid cells to identify the two species' presences and absences on the
landscape with exceptional resolution, and field validated 29,050 cells in 15,001 km of driving. We used the resulting
presence/absence data to train SDMs for each Joshua tree species, revealing the contemporary environmental gradients (during
the past 40 years) with greatest influence on the current distribution of adult trees. While the environments occupied by Y.
brevifolia and Y. jaegeriana were similar in total aridity, they differed with respect to seasonal precipitation and temperature
ranges, suggesting the two species may have differing responses to climate change.Moreover, the species showed differing
potential to occupy each other's geographic ranges: modeled potential habitat for Y. jaegeriana extends throughout the range of Y.
brevifolia, while potential habitat for Y. brevifolia is not well represented within the range of Y. jaegeriana. By reproducing the
current range of the Joshua trees with high fidelity, our dataset can serve as a baseline for future research, monitoring, and
management of this species, including an increased understanding of dynamics at the trailing and leading margins of the species'
ranges and potential for climate refugia.},

	abstract = {The Great Basin underwent considerable environmental change during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, such as lower precipitation, increased temperatures, and the diminishment of lakes and wetlands. Archaeologists have long hypothesized that people responded by altering their settlement-subsistence strategies. Models outlining these responses feature predictions that generally fall into two categories: (1) people should have spent more time in remaining productive patches and expanded their diet breadth; and (2) people should have added new habitats to their settlement-subsistence regimes. These responses are not mutually exclusive, and both may have occurred, but they have been difficult to evaluate using empirical data because the region’s archaeological record is predominantly comprised of open-air lithic scatters that lack food remains. Through ecological niche modeling, we test the hypothesis that early Holocene groups added new habitats. We develop two models—one for the Younger Dryas and one for the early Holocene—using recorded Paleoindian sites in Humboldt County, Nevada and a set of environmental variables. Our results show that Younger Dryas sites mostly occur around lowland and upland lakes and within ecotones, while early Holocene sites mostly occur around valley bottoms, riparian corridors, and upland springs. They demonstrate that people added new habitats, presumably in response to disappearing wetlands. This shift may be best explained using the patch choice model.},

	abstract = {A central theme for conservation is understanding how animals differentially use, and are affected by change in, the landscapes they inhabit. However, it has been challenging to develop conservation schemes for habitat-specific behaviors. Here we use behavioral change point analysis to identify behavioral states of golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) in the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts of the southwestern United States, and we identify, for each behavioral state, conservation-relevant habitat associations. We modeled behavior using 186,859 GPS points from 48 eagles and identified 2,851 distinct segments comprising four behavioral states. Altitude above ground level (AGL) best differentiated behavioral states, with two clusters of short-distance movement behaviors characterized by low AGL (state 1 AGL = 14 m (median); state 2 AGL = 11 m) and two associated with longer-distance movement behaviors and characterized by higher AGL (state 3 AGL = 108 m; state 4 AGL = 450 m). Behaviors such as perching and low-altitude hunting were associated with short-distance movements in updraft-poor environments, at higher elevations, and over steeper and more north-facing terrain. In contrast, medium-distance movements such as hunting and transiting were over gentle and south-facing slopes. Long-distance transiting occurred over the desert habitats that generate the best updraft. This information can guide management of this species, and our approach provides a template for behavior-specific habitat associations for other species of management concern.},

	abstract = {Accurate population estimates are essential for monitoring and managing wildlife populations. Mark–recapture sampling methods have regularly been used to estimate population parameters for rare and cryptic species, including the federally listed Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii); however, the methods employed are often plagued by violations of statistical assumptions, which have the potential to bias density estimates. By incorporating spatial information into conventional density estimation models, spatial capture–recapture (SCR) models can account for common assumption violations such as spatially heterogeneous detection probabilities and temporary emigration when animals leave plots during a survey. We conducted mark–recapture surveys at 10 1-km2 plots in and adjacent to the Ivanpah Valley of California and Nevada from 2015 to 2019. Locality data were collected concurrently using radio-telemetry and GPS data loggers. GPS data demonstrated that desert tortoises frequently exhibited temporary emigration outside a plot during the survey periods, thereby complicating standard approaches for closed-model density estimation. We integrated mark–recapture survey data for subadults and adults at each plot with corresponding spatial capture locations and supplementary spatial data using a modified SCR model fitted in a Bayesian framework. We compared density estimates modeled with conventional non-spatial methods, as well as three SCR models based on symmetrical usage areas described by various levels and types of supplementary spatial data. The conventional model consistently resulted in inflated estimates of density while the SCR models allowed us to generate spatially corrected estimates for a species where detectability and densities are low. However, we found that if not properly specified, the temporal scale of supplementary data may result in an unintended source of bias in parameter estimates. Integrating spatial data over a larger temporal scale than mark–recapture surveys were conducted resulted in higher detection probabilities and lower density estimates, due to an overestimation of space use. Our results not only demonstrate the importance of accounting for spatial information but also the value of understanding the potential for bias when integrating multiple data sets at different temporal resolutions. The methods presented can be used to enhance monitoring efforts for the Mojave desert tortoise and other species where mark–recapture methods are used.},

	abstract = {The Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), federally listed as threatened, has
suffered habitat loss and fragmentation due to human activities. Upper respiratory tract
disease (URTD), a documented health threat to desert tortoises, has been detected at
the Large-Scale Translocation Study Site (LSTS) in southwestern Nevada, a fenced
recipient site for translocated animals. This study aims to: i) estimate prevalence of
URTD and Mycoplasma infection at LSTS and three nearby unfenced sites, ii) assess
whether Mycoplasma infection status was associated with developing clinical signs of
URTD, iii) determine whether such an association differed between LSTS and
unfenced areas. We sampled 421 tortoises in 2016 to describe the current status of
these populations. We evaluated three clinical signs of URTD (nasal discharge, ocular
discharge, nasal erosions) and determined individual infection status for M.
agassizii and M. testudineum by qPCR and ELISA. In 2016, LSTS had the highest
prevalence of M. agassizii (25.0\%; 33/132), M. testudineum (3.0\%; 4/132), and URTD
clinical signs (18.9\%; 25/132). Controlling for other factors, clinical sign(s) were
positively associated with M. agassizii infection (OR=7.7, P=0.001), and this effect was
similar among study sites (P{\textgreater}0.99). There was no association with M.
testudineum status (P=0.360). Of the 196 tortoises in a longitudinal comparison of
2011-2014 with 2016, an estimated 3.2\% converted from M. agassizii-negative to -
positive during the study period, and incidence was greater at LSTS (P=0.002).
Conversion to positive M. agassizii status was associated with increased incidence of
clinical signs in subsequent years (OR=11.1, P=0.018). While M. agassizii and URTD
are present outside the LSTS, there is a possibility that incidence
of Mycoplasma infection and URTD would increase outside LSTS if these populations
were to reconnect. Population-level significance of this risk appears low and any risk
must be evaluated against the potential long-term benefits to population viability
through increased connectivity.},

	abstract = {The ‘bet hedging’ life history strategy of long-lived iteroparous species reduces short-term reproductive output to minimize the risk of reproductive failure over a lifetime. For desert-dwelling ectotherms living in variable and unpredictable environments, reproductive output is further influenced by precipitation and temperature via effects on food availability and limits on activity. We assembled multiple (n = 12) datasets on egg production for the threatened Agassiz’s desert tortoise Gopherus agassizii across its range and used these data to build a range-wide predictive model of annual reproductive output as a function of annual weather variation and individual-level attributes (body size and prior-year reproductive status). Climate variables were more robust predictors of reproductive output than individual-level attributes, with overall reproductive output positively related to prior-year precipitation and an earlier start to the spring activity season, and negatively related to spring temperature extremes (monthly temperature range in March–April). Reproductive output was highest for individuals with larger body sizes that reproduced in the previous year. Expected annual reproductive output from 1990-2018 varied from 2–5 eggs per female per year to 6-–12 eggs, with a weak decline in expected reproductive output over this time (p = 0.02). Climate-driven environmental variation in expected reproductive output was highly correlated across all 5 Recovery Units for this species (Pearson’s r {\textgreater} 0.9). Overall, our model suggests that climate change could strongly impact Agassiz’s desert tortoise reproductive output, and could have a negative population-level effect if precipitation is significantly reduced across the species’ range as predicted under some climate models.},

	url = {http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20211033},
	abstract = {Executive SummaryThe historic distribution of Mojave desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) was relatively continuous across the range, and the importance of tortoise habitat outside of designated tortoise conservation areas (TCAs) to recovery has long been recognized for its contributions to supporting gene flow between TCAs and to minimizing impacts and edge effects within TCAs. However, connectivity of Mojave desert tortoise populations has become a concern because of recent and proposed development of large tracts of desert tortoise habitat that cross, fragment, and surround designated conservation areas. This paper summarizes the underlying concepts and importance of connectivity for Mojave desert tortoise populations by reviewing current information on connectivity and providing information to managers for maintaining or enhancing desert tortoise population connectivity as they consider future proposals for development and management actions.Maintaining an ecological network for the Mojave desert tortoise, with a system of core habitats (TCAs) connected by linkages, is necessary to support demographically viable populations and long-term gene flow within and between TCAs. There are four points for wildlife and land-management agencies to consider when making decisions that could affect connectivity of Mojave desert tortoise populations (for example, in updating actions in resource management plans or amendments that could help maintain or restore functional connectivity in light of the latest information):Management of all desert tortoise habitat for persistence and connectivity. Desert tortoise populations continue to decline within most TCAs, and it is unlikely that trends are better in populations outside protected areas. Fragmentation exacerbates negative population trends by breaking large continuous populations into smaller isolated populations. Connectivity within large populations can enhance resilience to localized disturbances due to rescue by neighboring individuals. In contrast, smaller fragmented populations are resistant to rescue by their isolation and thus could suffer irreversible declines to extirpation from a variety of threats and stochastic events. Enhanced threat reduction to reverse declines within TCAs and to maintain occupied habitat in the surrounding matrix would help reduce the variability in population growth rates and improve the resilience of protected populations even while implementing efforts to improve connectivity.Each TCA has unique strengths and weaknesses regarding its ability to support minimum sustainable populations based on areal extent and its ability to support population increases based on landscape connection with adjacent populations. Considering how proposed projects (inside or outside of TCAs) affect connectivity and the ability of TCAs to support at least 5,000 adult tortoises (the numerical goal for each TCA) could help managers to maintain the resilience of TCAs to population declines. The same project, in an alternative location, could have very different impacts on local and regional populations. For example, within the habitat matrix surrounding TCAs, narrowly delineated corridors may not allow for natural population dynamics if they},

Thermal imagery from Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor was gathered for a period between 2004 and 2017. Using parcel data, the time series of Landsat data was sampled for areas that had undergone development during that time. A set of generalized linear models was conducted to determine expected temperature change with land cover class. It was found that recently developed regions within Reno-Sparks are 0.6oC warmer on average than the undeveloped desert grasses and sage. When wetlands/irrigated greenery were converted, it resulted in an increase of over 2oC. This research has shown that the Reno-Sparks surface urban heat island has undergone local, but measurable, growth in the past fourteen years.},

	abstract = {Noninvasive fecal genotyping can be a useful tool for population monitoring of elusive species. We tested extraction protocols on scat samples from the threatened Mojave Desert tortoise, Gopherus agassizii, to evaluate whether scat-based mark–recapture and population genetic monitoring studies are feasible. We extracted DNA from G. agassizii scat samples collected in California and Nevada using several extraction protocols and evaluated the reliability of resulting genotypes using quality scores, maximum likelihood reliability estimates, and paired scat and blood genotypes from the same individuals. Finally, we assessed probabilities of identity and sibship, and locus amplification quality, and calculated genotyping error rates for 19 microsatellite loci to determine the best set of loci to use with G. agassizii scat extractions. We found that genotype quality depended more on the sample quality than on the extraction method, and that the Qiagen DNeasy Plant Mini extraction kit is an efficient method for extracting DNA from tortoise scat. We identified 6 G. agassizii microsatellite loci that can be used to generate a unique molecular tag for individual tortoises. We characterized the reliability of an additional 13 microsatellite loci for use in population genetic analyses where additional power at the expense of some increase in error may be advantageous. As proof of concept, with very low error rates, we matched 3 opportunistically collected scat samples to blood genotypes from animals captured during population surveys within the study area and discovered at least 3 new individuals, even after 2 yrs of extensive survey work. These results suggest that genotyping of field-collected scat can complement existing methods used in long-term demographic and movement studies of G. agassizii and other, closely related, tortoise species.},

	url = {https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3422},
	abstract = {A key assumption in species distribution modeling (SDM) with presence-background (PB)
methods is that sampling of occurrence localities is unbiased and that any sampling bias is proportional to
the background distribution of environmental covariates. This assumption is rarely met when SDM practi-
tioners rely on federated museum records from natural history collections for geo-located occurrences due
to inherent sampling bias found in these collections. We use a simulation approach to explore the effective-
ness of three methods developed to account for sampling bias in SDM with PB frameworks. Two of the meth-
ods rely on careful filtering of observation data—geographic thinning (G-Filter) and environmental thinning
(E-Filter)—while a third, FactorBiasOut, creates selection weights for background data to bias locations
toward areas where the observation dataset was sampled. While these methods have been assessed previ-
ously, evaluation has emphasized spatial predictions of habitat potential. Here, we dig deeper into the effec-
tiveness of these methods by exploring how sampling bias not only affects predictions of habitat potential,
but also our understanding of niche characteristics such as which explanatory variables and response curves
best represent species–environment relationships. We simulate 100 virtual species ranging from generalist to
specialist in their habitat preferences and introduce geographic and environmental bias at three intensity
levels to measure the effectiveness of each correction method to (1) predict true probability of occurrence
across a study area, (2) recover true species–environment relationships, and (3) identify true explanatory
variables. We find that the FactorBiasOut most often showed the greatest improvement in recreating known
distributions but did no better at correctly identifying environmental covariates or recreating species–envi-
ronment relationships than G-Filter or E-Filter methods. Narrow niche species are most problematic for
biased calibration datasets, such that correction methods can, in some cases, make predictions worse},

A priority species list of native plant taxa was developed to guide seed collectors, commercial growers, resource managers, and restoration practitioners in support of the Bureau of Land Management’s Mojave Desert Native Plant Program. We identify focal plant taxa that are important for habitats of the threatened Mojave desert tortoise, a widely distributed herbivore in low and middle elevations, and pollinator taxa, including mostly Lepidopterans and Apoidean bees, some of whose populations are in decline. We identified 201 unique plant taxa in the diets of tortoises, and 49 taxa that provide thermal cover for tortoises with some overlapping taxa that provide both diet and cover. We discuss 134 native pollinators associated with plants used for nectaring, larval hosts, or cover and nesting materials. Detailed plant species accounts describe the status-of-knowledge for 57 plant taxonomic groups including detailed information on life history, ecology, and pollinator syndrome relevant to restoration success, methods of seed harvesting, propagation, and historic use in restoration are included. Our approach for developing a priority plant species list for the Mojave Desert provides a data-guided listing of species for restoration practitioners and identifies knowledge gaps for future investigation.},

	abstract = {Corvids are a native species in the Mojave Desert, but their population has increased throughout the years due to resources provided by humans (ex. landfills, agriculture, standing water etc.).Increased presence of Common Ravens may have negative impacts on critically endangered or threatened species with overlapping home ranges, such as the Desert Tortoise. We are developing statistical models to provide spatial context of Common Raven (Corvus corvax) nest density, nesting preferences, and nesting success throughout Desert Tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) Critical Habitat Units (CHU) in the Mojave Desert of California. This work will increase our understanding on the potential influence of anthropogenic features and subsidies in the desert, provide a spatial context on Common Raven threats to Desert Tortoise populations, and may have the potential to improve management tools and practices in managing the Common Raven populations, which may aid in recovering Desert Tortoise populations.

The Mojave Desert Ecosystem encompasses approximately 1,918,252 hectares of critical habitat for the Desert Tortosie. Due to the large spatial scale of targeted study areas, data were collected to optimize raven observations during nesting season (March-June), which resulted in spatial bias in the observations toward transmission pole lines and roads. To reduce bias, we will analyze nest survey data by using a variety of spatial methods, including spatial bootstrapping comparisons with null models, point process models, and geostatistical analyses. We will analyze nest site selection to determine differences in habitat attributes that may influence nest site preference (such as resources or topography). Nest density and nest success will be modeled to analyze the influence of anthropogenic resources and nesting substrate selection. Covariates for each model will include: proximity to resources (landfills, agriculture, water source), proximity to roads and urbanized areas, nest substrate type, and local estimates vegetation density, temperature, and precipitation.},

	abstract = {The Mojave Desert is a vast and diverse landscape in the southwestern United States, encompassing 127,689km2. This ecoregion is bordered by the colder and wetter Great Basin desert to the north, and the warmer and wetter Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts to the south. Spanning from 86m below sea level at Badwater Basin in Death Valley, California, to 3632m at its highest mountains near Las Vegas, Nevada, the Mojave is the driest of the four North American deserts, in part due to the rain-shadow caused by the Transverse Ranges on its western edge. Extremes of moisture availability, temperature, physiographic variety, and soil diversity all are key in the formation of this unique landscape, and the divergence of its inhabitants over time. While the Mojave is often considered an intermediary with respect to the plants and animals that occupy the Great Basin and Sonoran Deserts, there are many species unique to the Mojave that aid in highlighting its unique characteristics. The Joshua Tree, Mojave Desert Tortoise, Mohave ground squirrel, and several species of fringe-toed lizards are all endemics to this ecoregion that have adapted to this austere environment. There is also a wide array of fishes and aquatic invertebrates that occupy the Mojave's sparse and discontinuous waterways and springs. Nearly all of these Mojave endemics are the subjects of conservation concern facing a rapidly changing environment driven by increasing human populations and land use, and a changing climate.},

	abstract = {We challenged the common practice of using a single mean absorptance based on unfiltered skylight spectra to model operative temperature for reptiles in filtered light habitats by examining the effects of plant canopies on light transmittance. To assess differences in light filtration over a range of microhabitats, spectra were recorded under canopies of desert plants, tropical plants, and under unfiltered skylight. Spectra were then integrated with absorptivity curves of desert reptiles to determine if differences in light quality among microhabitat types changed integrated mean absorptance. Finally, we used the desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) as a case study to investigate the effects of filtered microhabitats on paint choice for physical operative temperature models and determined the magnitude of error that could result from discrepancies between paint and animal absorptance. We found that light energy was partitioned similarly among microhabitats with like canopy types and that most variation was explained by differences in transmittance between the visible and near infrared wavelengths. Mean absorptance for reptiles was similar among microhabitats with the greatest differences observed between animals in unfiltered skylight and under tropical canopies. In most microhabitats paint and tortoise absorptances differed, but operative temperatures were nearly identical within microhabitats no matter the absorptance used in the model. The findings of this study support the use of a single mean absorptance in modeling operative temperature for reptiles in a variety of habitats.},

	abstract = {Maintaining historic corridors for gene flow is crucial to ensuring the survival and recovery of threatened and endangered species. The Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) is federally listed as a threatened species, and inhabits a wide array of habitat types. Major desert tortoise population centers are located within relatively flat bajadas and valleys while passes through mountain ranges can serve as important corridors linking those population centers. Desert tortoises are generally corridor-dwellers, so effective corridors must be able to sustain individuals living in the corridors to serve as linkages between populations. Species distribution models (SDMs) can be a useful tool to identify and locate corridors, though low resolutions of predictions may obscure features (e.g. cliff faces) that act as important barriers to desert tortoise movement. Two potential corridors through mountain passes around the Ivanpah Valley, NV/CA were located using predictions from a previously developed model (1-km2 resolution). Movements of all known adult tortoises (n = {\textasciitilde}100) on 1-km2 plots within the corridors were tracked for three years with VHF telemetry and GPS loggers. Comparing these tortoise locations with the habitat prediction suggests that tortoises are not necessarily using space as predicted by the model. To improve modeling of these and other corridors, we explore two different methods of rescaling SDMs to improve their predictive abilities. We downscaled the original model using a cubic spline algorithm and created a new ensemble model using smaller resolution predictor variables. We compared these two model predictions of tortoise use within the corridors to actual tortoise use. Understanding how these two approaches predict tortoise use of corridors can help identify other natural corridor use that is important to desert tortoise population connectivity.},

	abstract = {Effective management of threatened and endangered species (TES) requires accurate assessment of vulnerability to environmental changes and of the adaptive capacity to weather those changes. The Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) provides an excellent system for studying population resilience to environmental change, as many populations have been monitored extensively across its range, allowing us to leverage long-term longitudinal demographic data across diverse environments. Beginning in the 1970s and continuing for decades, capture mark-recapture (CMR) surveys were conducted repeatedly at dozens of 2.6 km2 ‘permanent study plots’ across the range of the species. Although primarily used for estimating abundance trends, these permanent study plots represent an invaluable resource for estimating the environmental sensitivities of key tortoise demographic rates. We are currently leading an effort to re-analyze the permanent study plot data where the species occurs in Nevada and northeastern Arizona using modern spatial capture-recapture methods (SCR). Results from these re-analyses confirm that adult tortoise survival is largely insensitive to environmental gradients; however, recruitment and short-distance movement rates appear to be more variable and sensitive to climatic and edaphic conditions. In addition, we were able to generate tortoise density estimates with greater precision using SECR than were possible under previous analytical approaches. These analyses represent a critical first step in our efforts to assess the climate resilience of Mojave Desert Tortoise populations and to identify critical habitat areas capable of supporting tortoise populations long into the future.},

	abstract = {Off-highway vehicle (OHV) recreation is increasing throughout the southwestern US, and can adversely affect habitat and abundance of many plants and animals. Within the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreational Area (ISDRA) in southeast California, USA, management plans have been implemented since 1974 and more intensely since 2000 to manage OHV activity in order to reduce disturbance impacts to sensitive wildlife such as the Colorado fringe-toed lizard (Uma notata) and sensitive plants. To understand the relationship among habitat, disturbance, and the ecological requirements for Uma lizards, we conducted a multi-year study (2014-2016) using stratified randomly placed transects throughout five ISDRA management areas. We surveyed environmental parameters including geographic location, air and surface temperatures, precipitation, wind speed, cloud cover, presence and number of OHV tracks, trash, and crushed vegetation as well as the abundance of key perennial vegetation species along each transect. We found that surface temperature (30-48 °C) and the abundance of the perennial plant Eriogonum deserticola best explained lizard detection and density. Lizard density increased in habitats providing the largest sand dunes and longer-term management (since 2000) restricting OHV activity. Although Wilderness areas within ISDRA were closed to OHV recreation in 1974, we found fewer lizards there than in other protected areas; much of the Wilderness area was represented by dunes stabilized by Larrea tridentata scrub vegetation or interspersed by ancient lakebed clay soils and may not represent optimal habitat for Uma lizards. Our finding supports that management actions reducing OHV activity in high sand dune habitats over longer periods ({\textgreater}15 years) will likely increase the density of Colorado fridge-toed lizards and promote habitat features needed to support robust populations},

	abstract = {Landscape-scale habitat changes including urbanization, increased wildfires, and invasive species are rapidly increasing throughout the southwestern United States. While extensive research and conservation efforts have been directed towards understanding the effects of altered habitats in adult tortoise populations, little is known about habitat features that may support younger tortoise cohorts. To understand the relationship between habitats and the ecological requirements for juvenile tortoises, we conducted a multi-year study (Fall 2014 – Spring 2017) using translocated captive juvenile Mojave desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) at three desert sites in Clark County, Nevada, USA. We surveyed site features including annual and perennial vegetation, soil textures, rodent burrows, climate features, etc. at each site. In addition, we monitored growth, health, movement, and survival for juvenile tortoises. After evaluating habitat and climate patterns during the project, we found that annual plant production best explained patterns of improved performance (growth, survival) in juveniles. Annual plants were highly variable both in production and species richness throughout 2015 and 2016, with limited production in 2015. Consequently, we also recorded limited growth for most juveniles throughout that year. We found that juveniles generally grew more, increased movement and home range, and had higher survival in habitats with less invasive non-native annual vegetation (e.g. Bromus rubens, Schismus barbartus) compared to sites with increased native forage plants. Our findings support previous research on the potential negative effects of non-native annual plants for young tortoises. When possible, reducing non-native vegetation or protecting habitats from potential plant invasions and other disturbances may improve recruitment and conservation for this species.},
